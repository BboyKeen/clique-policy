In general, the Data Controller is the sole recipient of the Data. 

However, the Data Controller may be required to transfer the Data to other Recipients and/or to any public authority that may request it, particularly in the context of an investigation.

The Data Controller undertakes to require from its Subcontractors sufficient guarantees as to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures in such manner that the Processing meets the legal and regulatory requirements and guarantees the protection of the rights of the Data Subject, in particular in the event of transfer of the Data outside the European Union. 

In case of transfer of Data outside the European Union, to a third country not recognized by the European Commission as having an adequate level of Data protection, the Data Controller undertakes to implement appropriate safeguards provided as necessary by:



* Standard data protection clauses ;
* Binding corporate rules;
* A code of conduct with a binding and enforceable commitment by the Data Controller in the third country to implement appropriate safeguards;
* A certification mechanism with a binding and enforceable commitment by the Data Controller in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards. 

In addition, the Data Controller may disclose the Data that is subject to Processing to any Recipient or Third Party where a legal obligation to do so exists or where the Data Controller considers in good faith that it is necessary to:



* Respond to any claim against it;
* Comply with the requirements of the judiciary order and/or the administrative order and/or the Supervisory Authority;
* Enforce any contract to which the Data Subject is a party;
* Safeguard the vital interests of any individual;

In the event of reasonable doubt as to the identity of the Data Subject requesting the exercise of his/her rights over the Data, the Data Controller may request that a copy of an official identity document be attached to the request. 

Requests will be processed as soon as possible and at the latest in accordance with the deadlines established by the Legislation.

The Data Controller undertakes not to process the Data any further, unless he/she can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing that override the interests and rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

* The Data Subject has objected to the Processing in accordance with Article 5.3, during the verification as to whether the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller prevail over those of the Data Subject.

The Data Subject who has obtained the limitation of the Processing of the Data is informed by the Data Controller before the limitation of the Processing is lifted. 


## 8.5 Right to Data portability

The Data Subject has the right to receive the Data he or she has provided to the Data Controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and has the right to transmit such data to another Data Controller without the Data Controller's interference, where:

* The Processing is carried out by means of automated processes.

The Data Subject, when exercising his/her right to Data portability, has the right to have the Data transferred directly from the Controller to another Controller, where technically possible.
